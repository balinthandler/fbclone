# Facebook Clone

This is the [final project](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-ruby-on-rails/courses/ruby-on-rails/lessons/final-project) of `The Odin Project`'s `Ruby on Rails` course.

### Assignment:
Build Facebook! You’ll build a large portion of the core Facebook user functionality in this project. We won’t be worrying about the Javascript-heavy front end stuff but you won’t need it to get a nice user experience. As usual, any additional styling will be up to you but the really important stuff is to get the data and back end working properly. You’ll put together some of the core features of the platform – users, profiles, “friending”, posts, news feed, and “liking”. You’ll also implement sign-in with the real Facebook by using OmniAuth and Devise.

Some features of Facebook we haven’t yet been exposed to – for instance chat, realtime updates of the newsfeed, and realtime notifications. You won’t be responsible for creating those unless you’d like to jump ahead and give it a shot.
